GALUTINIS

The goal of this project is to implement an application to manage and get information about books.

It will implement a back-end Spring Boot application and a front-end React application.

APPLICATIONS:

1. GALUTINIS-API:

Web Java backend application exposes a Rest API to create, retrieve, edit and delete books.

The application secured endpoints can just be accessed if a valid JWT access token is provided.

order-api stores its data in H2 database.
  
2. GALUTINIS-UI:
  
  In order to access the application, a `user` or `admin` must login using his/her `username` and `password`. All the requests coming from `front-end` to secured endpoints in `back-end` have the JWT access token. This token is generated when the `user` or `admin` logins.
